      Prompt for React Interview Challenge:

      You are tasked with building a dogs breed search application using React.
      The application should display a list of dog breeds that we retrieve from a “dogs API”, and allow the user to filter the list client side.

      Requirements:

      Investigate the dog API documentation https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
      Implement an API call to retrieve dog breeds data using the dog API 
      Manage the state of the application to store the retrieved data.
      Display the dog breeds in a bulleted list.
      Handle any potential errors or loading states during the API call and display appropriate feedback to the user. 
      Display an input so that users can filter the list clientside
      List items can be clicked, if they are -> we should call a new endpoint that returns images of that specific dog breed, we should display a single image on top of the list.


      Bonus (optional):

      Add a feature to allow users to save dog breeds to a favorite list that you can then display on the side, and its persisted after a browser refresh.


      Good luck!
